This is puppet-runonce a puppet module for running special timers.

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions on getting this installed.
Look in the examples/ folder for usage. If none exist, please contribute one!
This code may be a work in progress. The interfaces may change without notice.
Patches are welcome, but please be patient. They are best received by email.
Please ping me if you have big changes in mind, before you write a giant patch.

Module specific notes:
* If you expect the timers in this module to be 100% accurate, you're insane.
* Read through the code if you want to learn the semantics of how this works.

Dependencies:
